## Don't use spaces. Use the underscore.
`pwd` means present working directory. Exclamation point is called a bang (means run command again). A pound sign followed by an exclamation #! is called a Shebang. 
There are 3 sets of permissions: owner, group, and other. When reading a file ex 1: -rw-r--r student student   This is a file and not a directory. A directory will begin with a "d."
This means that the owner (student) of the file or directory has read and write permissions, but not execute. The group name (student) has read permission but not write or execute. Every other user has read permiss but not execute. Full permiss have rwx. The chmod command can change these permissions.
### the mv command
1. Renames a file 2. Moves a group of files. When moving to a nonexisting file, the old file is deleted and new file with new name is created. ex 1: there are 4 files A,B,C,D -> `mv` A to "corn.txt"   Sys will ask for confirmation before erasing file. There are still 4 files B,C,D,corn.txt  If moving to an existing file, it is overwritten and old file is erased
ex 2: 4 files and 2 have text. B contains "text in here", C ,D , corn.txt "corn text" -> `mv` corn.txt B -> `cat` B "corn text", C , D  There is now 3 files, corn.txt is gone. Using option -i will prompt confirmation before erasing. Using -f will force the overwrite if the file has weak overwrite protection. -n (no-clobber) prevents existing file from being overwrittens like nothing happened. -b creates backup of exisitng file with tilde ~ appended. 
ex 3: 4 files B,C,D, corn.txt (the files have text in them like before)-> `mv -b corn.txt B` -> `ls` B, B~,C,D   
### other commands
`df` Means disk free. Shows amount of free disk space and the file systems that have been mounted. Mounted- the directory in which the file sys appears.
`free`- provides info on amount of physical and swap memory    `grep`- (Globally search for Regular Expression and Print out) searches file for specified patterns. Basically Ctrl+f  `ls -la` is to list all files and directories  `curl [options] [URL]`- transfer data to or from a server, using any of the supported protocols. Powered by Libcurl.  `ping [options] destination]`- determine whether a remote destination IP is active or inactive. You can also find the round-trip delay in communicating with the destination and check whether there is a packet loss. Ping works by sending one or more ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request packages to a specified destination IP on the network and waits for a reply. When the destination receives the package, it responds with an ICMP echo reply. ex 1: `ping googl.com`  Ping will continue to send ICMP packages until it receives an interrupt signal. To specify the number of Echo Request packages to be sent after which ping will exit, use the -c option followed by the number of the packages. ex 2: `ping -c 2 linuxize.com`   `fping`- pings multiple websites
`apt` installs, updates, removes Deb packages. Deb is the installation package format for all Debian based distributions. Debian is the oldest operating system in Linux and distributes free and open-source software. `gdebi` is used to install local Deb packages. It will install and resolve issues when downloading a package. `dpkg` also installs Deb packages, however it will not resolve and dependency issues. Dependency- when one package relies on another package to work. Helps reduce disk usage.
`export`- When new shell is opened, environment variables are set. If they are changed (EX walk= "2mi" or Dog=fluffy), the shell can't tell. `export` updates the shell with the new variables.By itself the command shows all exported variables.  `ssh`- creates secure connection to remote machine, allows transfer of files without interference, and allows commands to be executed on the remote machine.  `scp`- allows files to be copied between one or two remote hosts. Works like `ssh`.  `rsync`- versatile copying tool. Copies files over secured path, famous for its delta-transfer algorithim (send only the difference in data from source files to existing files at destination).
`crontab`- opens the cron table. This is the list of tasks scheduled to run at intervals on the system. The daemon that reads the cron tab and executes the commands is called the cron. daemon- program that runs in the background without user interaction.
`ls`- lists all files and directorys. There are many options to change what `ls` shows. Ex: `lsof` lists all open files. `ls -l` or `ls -la` will list all contents in a table format. This can show permissions for files/directories and can be changed with `chown` & `chmod`.
`groups`- shows which groups the current user is a part of. Can enter name of another user and see those groups as well. Username will be followed by a : and then the groups are listed.
### chmod command 
`chmod [OPTIONS] [ugoa...][-+=] FILE`- change the permissions on a file using either a symbolic or numeric mode or a reference file. The first set of flags ([ugoa…]), users flags, defines which users classes the permissions to the file are changed. u means the file owner, g means the users who are members of the group, o defines all other users, a is all the users defined by UGA. The second set of flags ([-+=]), the operation flags, defines whether the permissions are to be removed, added, or set. Minus removes perms, plus adds, and equal changes the current permissions to the specified permissions. If no permissions are specified after the = symbol, all permissions from the specified user class are removed. ex 1: Give the members of the group permission to read the file, but not to write and execute it `chmod g=r filename` ex 2: Remove the execute permission for all users `chmod a-x filename` ex 3: Remove the read, write, and execute permission for all users except the file’s owner `chmod og-rwx filename` OR `chmod og= filename` ex 4: Give read, write and execute permission to the file’s owner, read permissions to the file’s group and no permissions to all other users `chmod u=rwx,g=r,o= filename` NOTE NO SPACES
The perms can also be changed with numbers. Each write, read, and execute permissions have the following number value: r (read) = 4  w (write) = 2  x (execute) = 1  no permissions = 0  ex 5: to give read, write and execute permission to the file’s owner, read and execute permissions to the file’s group and only read permissions to all other users `chmod 754 filename` 
### chown command 
`chown [OPTIONS] USER[:GROUP] FILE(s)`- change the user and/or group ownership of a given file, directory, or symbolic link. USER is the user name or the user ID (UID) of the new owner. GROUP is the name of the new group or the group ID (GID). FILE(s) is the name of one or more files, directories or links. Numeric IDs should be prefixed with the + symbol. 
USER - If only the user is specified, the specified user will become the owner of the given files, the group ownership is not changed.
USER: - When the username is followed by a colon :, and the group name is not given, the user will become the owner of the files, and the files group ownership is changed to user’s login group.  USER:GROUP - If both the user and the group are specified (with no space betwen them), the user ownership of the files is changed to the given user and the group ownership is changed to the given group. :GROUP - If the User is omitted and the group is prefixed with a colon :, only the group ownership of the files is changed to the given group.  : If only a colon : is given, without specifying the user and the group, no change is made
Normal users can change the group of the file only if they own the file and only to a group of which they are a member. Administrative users can change the group ownership of all files. Use `ls -l` to find out who owns a file or what group the file belongs to. To change the owner of a file use the chown command followed by the user name of the new owner and the target file as an argument. ex 1: `chown linuxize file1`  To change the ownership of multiple files or directories, specify them as a space-separated list. ex 2: `chown linuxize file1 dir1`   The numeric user ID (UID) can be used instead of the username. If a numeric owner exists as a user name, then the ownership will be transferred to the user name. To avoid this prefix the ID with +. ex 3: `chown [+]9001 file1`
### git command
`Git` is a massivly useful tool with many many many MANY command options. The basics are that `git` is used to work with many people on one project. It creates copies of files that each person can use, change, and return to original file. One file can be shared across multiple servers and all users can see the changed data. It tracks changes at any point in time so anyone can return to the file in a previous point. `Git` works with the websit github to create repositories (repos). They are containers for projects tracked by `git`. Repos can be local, only being available on your own system. Or they can be remote which is how multiple people can work on the same project. 
1. `git init` starts git file for git to track. `git status` checks on status of file. Text will appear in red for untracked file. This helps keep track of changes made to which files. 
2. `git add` + name of file to specify what is being added. Text will turn green and user is told there are changes to be committed.
3. `git commit -m "message about what the file is; why this is committed`   `git log` will show what commits were made, what time, and message   
4. `git push` will push data to specified area. In this case, to the github account.  `git pull` can be used to pull new info from account to user server.
`wget [OPTIONS] [URL]`- download files using HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols. Wget provides a number of options allowing to download multiple files, resume downloads, limit the bandwidth, recursive downloads, download in the background, mirror a website, and much more. In its simplest form, when used without any option, wget will download the resource specified in the url to the current directory. -o option will save the download file under a different (specified) name. ex 1: `wget -O latest-hugo.zip https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/archive/master.zip` will save the download under file name 'latest-hugo.zip'   -p option saves download in a specific location ex 2: `wget -P /mnt/iso http://mirrors.mit.edu/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1804.iso` will save download file to /mnt/iso directory.  -c resumes a download. If the remote server does not support resuming downloads, wget will start the download from the beginning and overwrite the existing file. 
### Source Command
`source` also can be just a dot . - read and execute a file. The difference between sourcing a script and executing is that `source` executes the script in the current enbironment. Trying to execute a script in a different environment (child-like shell or process) will not work. The script must be sourced. `source` owrk
